## The gist of it is this

HeadForCode is a new thing, we have been quietly chipping away at the idea now for about a year and the website has been something of a background project for awhile. We have also been talking about the idea behind it with various people and with the aim of creating a small team to help develop the concept further. How did it come about? What exactly is HeadForCode?

Let us first talk about **Code** itself...

I am a firm believer that the world in which we live is not going to sit still for long and if anything, it is going to get a lot more _fidgety_ in the next few years. If you are a "Coder" you are going to have a very interesting time because I feel that many of the things we once considered to be the norm not so long ago, will become anything but. I also believe that more and more people will become involved in **Code** but maybe not in the traditional sense. I think everyone will soon be getting their hands dirty and building their own things. We are already seeing a proliferation of "build your own site without knowing anything about programming" services popping up left right and center, such as Wix and Squarespace for example. A lot of people have asked me about what people in my business will do when systems become able to write their own code, relegating developers to the dole queue? No that won't happen because we will still be needed to build such systems in the first place... as I say there are a lot off interesting things bubbling away across the World that will reshape the industry. It has evolved massively since the late 80's when I was learning to write programs in machine-code, assembly language and C++.

So we at HeadForCode we focus on research, mentoring and consultancy. We explore new ideas of how you can use code to improve the way you as an individual or as a business get the level best out of your technology, no matter whether we are talking about the web or mobile. We consider ourselves to have a "good head for code" much the same as a mathmetician has a good head for numbers or a historian can recall the dates of famous battles. You get the gist.

Knowledge is all very well but there is no point keeping it locked in our heads and that is why we like to mentor people and help them learn. To level up as we like to say.

We shall be running a number of online courses through this website.

## The website

We like to be revolutionary here and when it came to building this website, we first considered the normal paths that we could follow, we thought about using Wordpress or Drupal. We then thought again and hav opted to take a very different path by using the so called JAM Stack as our approach

## The team

We operate out of an office in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Just two of us. We have a third person too on the board of Directors but she is working on a different project at the current time. We plan to expand when we need to and we will probably only ever work with freelancers who could be working anywhere in the UK and beyond. In the future we may even stop renting office space and instead switch to a system by which we work from anywhere, wherever we are at any particular time.

My partner in crime is a young apprentice by the name of Dan Davis, he is learning fast and has a fabulous aptitude for the technology that we are working with.

## Our next steps

We are building this site using what we call "modern methods" but some of them may not sound that way, as we shall explain in the next article in this blog, keep your eyes peeled.

## Let's introduce ourselves

Welcome to the first ever HeadForCode blog post, 

where I am going to write about the development of this website, 

the business we are building. 

I like to think of this as the process of "bootstrapping" the business, we often talk of doing such things with web design, so why not do likewise with a business?

I shall be writing about the business as it evolves and how the site fits in with it over the coming months. 

As is often the case, I walk around with a lot of stuff in my head, 

my brain is full of code and I suspect there are many other men and women out there who are a lot like me. We spend our days thinking about how to do stuff, sometimes we actually do write code but a lot of the ideas go to waste, reconciled to a recycle bin in our minds. I think that is a shame because if we even just started to write out a few lines of code, even if just to make a note of them, we could end up developing some great new concepts.

So HeadForCode is the following things:

* A Research "Think Tank"
* A mentoring service
* A Consultancy

## Building our own platform 

We have in the past worked with tools such as Wordpress and Drupal for building websites but we've got to the point where we felt that it is time to try a whole new approach to site building using some new tools. In fact there is a lot to talk about in this respect, enough to blog about for days and months to come. 

This website is built using the JAM Stack which is a whole new way of thinking about building sites.

## Just write it down

I am a "thinker" and if you have found either myself or this website, you probably are too. One of the things I wish to achieve through HeadForCode is to establish a place where some of the ideas that I have are written down and then turned either into blog posts here or added somewhere else

## Sharing our thoughts and ideas

I have just added this line in here :-)

## Teaching others

## Providing services

## Our longer term vision

## Being social

add something - that is cool
