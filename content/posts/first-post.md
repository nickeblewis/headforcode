Welcome to a brand new blog and website called HeadForCode. We are a small business who are passionate about writing code on one hand but also enjoy teaching the subject too. We are learning a lot ourselves, a lot of the time because the industry never stands still. it is for this reason that we decided to two main things here from your point of view, the audience. We will blog a lot about building modern web applications with regular artciles and we are also going to be rinning a series of sceencast based short courses. some will ne free but mpst will be premium and will be fairly priced.


Our blog is going to begin by exploring tbe techniqjws and ideas bejind how we run this website, for it is not hosted via a traditional CMS system such as Wordpress
