You would of thought that sites built using the JAM Stack approach due to the fact that they are  __static__, can not handle forms. Well think again because you can build any form you wish and connect it with your Netlify account. In fact it is also possible to link your site with Zapier which we shall also explore whilst talking about building forms.
