## Our blurb...
The manic world of Web/Mobile development is a crazy place at the best of times. So much going on, too much to keep on top of and where do you fit in the time for R&D, to learn the new ways of achieving what you need to get done, whether for work or for personal interest.

HeadForCode is a business that helps take that weight of your shoulders. We commit our time to R&D, so that you don't need to start from scratch. We are constantly playing around with different things and getting paid to do so, which is cool.

The trick is to know how to be smart with technology, we often all too easily let it get the better of us and before we know it, we are stumped, brains frazzled and we end up totally bewildered. Well it needn't be like that at all....

## Who we are...

I had to start writing in that tone, I put my CMO hat on there and now back to CEO/CTO mode. Essentially we are two guys working out of an office in Farnborough, Hampshire. We code all day long, looking at the best ways of getting the best out of technology and helping drive forwards great UI ideas. It is an exciting place to be with quite some pace these days.

So my plan as the lead on this project, is to grow the team over time, starting with getting to know some great freelance talent around the UK.
