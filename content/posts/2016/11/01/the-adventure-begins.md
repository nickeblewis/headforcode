## Let's introduce ourselves

Welcome to the first ever HeadForCode blog post, 

where I am going to write about the development of this website, 

the business we are building. 

I like to think of this as the process of "bootstrapping" the business, we often talk of doing such things with web design, so why not do likewise with a business?

I shall be writing about the business as it evolves and how the site fits in with it over the coming months. 

As is often the case, I walk around with a lot of stuff in my head, 

my brain is full of code and I suspect there are many other men and women out there who are a lot like me. We spend our days thinking about how to do stuff, sometimes we actually do write code but a lot of the ideas go to waste, reconciled to a recycle bin in our minds. I think that is a shame because if we even just started to write out a few lines of code, even if just to make a note of them, we could end up developing some great new concepts.

So HeadForCode is the following things:

* A Research "Think Tank"
* A mentoring service
* A Consultancy

## Building our own platform 

We have in the past worked with tools such as Wordpress and Drupal for building websites but we've got to the point where we felt that it is time to try a whole new approach to site building using some new tools. In fact there is a lot to talk about in this respect, enough to blog about for days and months to come. 

This website is built using the JAM Stack which is a whole new way of thinking about building sites.

## Just write it down

I am a "thinker" and if you have found either myself or this website, you probably are too. One of the things I wish to achieve through HeadForCode is to establish a place where some of the ideas that I have are written down and then turned either into blog posts here or added somewhere else

## Sharing our thoughts and ideas

## Teaching others

## Providing services

## Our longer term vision

## Being social
