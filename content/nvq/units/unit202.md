# Unit 202 : Develop own effectiveness and professionalism

There is plenty to discuss below and I think this is quite a good unit when I read it more carefully. The aim of this is to help you think a bit more about the business of the IT industry. We are small, we certainly aren't corporate but we should still portray a professional image nonetheless. So let's start to make some progress on this and I will welcome any suggestions you make. There is never a daft question or idea (I've been told!).

## 5.1 List the aims and objectives of the organisation

- [ ] This is  a mission statement we don't have one so you could look at what we could have
    - [ ] Let me know what you have put together and have learnt about along the way
    - [ ] I shall write something myself and we can see how they compare
- [ ] Give some thought to where we would like the business to be in 6 months and where we would want to be in 5 years.  there isn't a right or wrong answer to this 
    - [ ] Let's discuss this when we are together and we can write down what we think makes sense to us

## 5.2 State the organisation’s brand or image

- [ ] The headforcode logo is our image 
    - [ ] I have images on the Mac that I shall share with you all
    - [ ] One thing we don't have yet is a "style guide", so let's create one and write about what it is
    - [ ] Then apply the style guide to this site and make sure our logo is displayed in as many places as possible
    - [ ] Where would you consider that logo to appear? Clue: Not just websites....

## 5.3 Identify the organisation’s structure, roles and responsibilities

- [ ] Structure Nick MD me Company Secretary you employee
    - Yes, pretty mucch and I would add that Tina is in fact a Director, we opted not to have a Secretary as it is no longer a legal requirement
    - We could research how other small startup companies are structured. 
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities you can have a go at making up
    - Let's chat about this in more detail and write up more detail here but some quick suggestions
        - Nick Lewis, Managing Director. I am a very non-traditional MD at the moment because my role is still and always will be very much a technical one. I will delegate more of my tasks to our Junior Developer as he evolves as a membr of the team.
        - Tina Lewis, Director. Tina has a wealth of knowledge about business, HSE, Laws and management. Tina is currently assigned to an off-site project for the next few years.
        - Dan Davis, Junior Developer. Dan is learning through his apprenticeship to become a developer.
- [ ] Look in companies house website for the official details
    - A good thing to know about and I shall show you where it is and how to find us on there

## 5.4 Identify potential improvements to working practices

- [ ] This is subjective so give us your thoughts
    - Oooh wow, very subjective. Thing is though, we are and should always consider that what we do is good but can always be better. Never rest on your laurels.
- [ ] Bear in mind how we can grow as, when and if we have more staff as we are in a new era as a business and have the potential to grow fast over the next year.
    - We won't grow in terms of people but we must develop products and market them. That said I know of some guys who could support us in various ways. I know of a Project Manager who is going freelance, a freelance developer (Lee) and we have Nadeem out in Mauritius.... opportunities to team up with people who can help us.

## Notes from Nick

Tina provided many of the hints above and there are quite a few things we need to help you with here for this part of Unit 202. So I am going to update this page further with links to further information and some new tasks that we can carry out in order to complete 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4
