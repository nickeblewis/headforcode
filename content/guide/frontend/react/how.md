## Lets get to know how it works better

![alt text](/assets/vsc-explorer.PNG "Visual Studio Code and the simple React app")

When you open Visual Studio Code and an associated project for the first time, you can do so a number of different ways but you should see the above in your application.

### Get to know your tools better and be more productive

We shall gradually get to explore how Visual Studio Code works over time and in fact if anyone is interested, we would be more than happy to write up some guides on VSC specifically, as there are various ways that you can use the application to get the best out of it and to be... Productive!!

### Some quick things to learn about

VSC is divided up into sections, on the far left we have the Sidebar and it is in this sidebar that we have access to:

* Explorer
* Search
* Git
* Debug
* Extensions

Click on any of the above and you will be taken to a different facet of the application. So for example we can get to the Explorer using __CTRL+SHIFT+E__ 

Furthermore we can show/hide the bar by using __CTRL+B__ at any time, useful for increasing your editing space on the screen or just to visually de-clutter.

## Exploring the application

Since we have been talking about the explorer and we are here mainly to talk about the app we created in the previous article, lets break down the folders and files that the __create_react_app__ generated for us...

* node_modules
* public
* src
* .gitignore
* README.md
* yarn.lock
