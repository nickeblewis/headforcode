Notes for our forthcoming BNI meeting:

It has been suggested by our mate Ken that we could do 3 pitches, if we do, we could do it like this

* Pitch 1 - Farnborough Guide looking for premium profile customers with video introductions
* Pitch 2 - Farnborough Guide looking to establish new key contacts in the local area, we'd like to tap into the contact knowledge in this room today
* Pitch 3 - HeadForCode the underlying company builds apps (which is what FG is fundamentally) for small to medium sized businesses. We offer free consultations and any project initiated via this meeting today will benefit from a 10% discount on price.

## Pitch 1

Good morning everyone, my name is {} and I would like to talk to you today about our new web project called Farnborough Guide. 

So what is Farnborough Guide? In short it is a site that is divided up into separate areas. There will be Events, Walks, Search and there will be more sections to come. FG aims to be as dynamic and as social as it possibly can be. We want it to feel like your website, a place you can depend on to find reliable local information. 

We want you to tell us about your businesses for the Search part of the site and you can do so by signing up for a "Premium Profile" and this is where our pitch for today comes into play. Your profile need not be just a static web page but we are going to incorporate video clips! So here is the deal, we come to you, shoot your video in which you have just 45 seconds to give your customer audience a good idea of who you are. Why should they buy their meat from you? Why are you the best choice for fitting their conservatory? Why your band is a great hire for weddings and pub nights?

We then edit the video, caption it and add titles complete with your business card details. The video then is published to the Farnborough Guide YouTube channel. Above all else you will get a page that bears your name and new videos are featured on the homepage of FG.

We think this is a great promotional tool to the people in the area. It would normally cost you £750 per year (including VAT) but to the people here today or anyone you refer this to, we are happy to offer it to you for £550!
