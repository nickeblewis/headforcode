Notes for our forthcoming BNI meeting:

It has been suggested by our mate Ken that we could do 3 pitches, if we do, we could do it like this

* Pitch 1 - Farnborough Guide looking for premium profile customers with video introductions
* Pitch 2 - Farnborough Guide looking to establish new key contacts in the local area, we'd like to tap into the contact knowledge in this room today
* Picth 3 - HeadForCode the underlying company builds apps (which is what FG is fundamentally) for small to medium sized businesses. We offer free consultations and any project initiated via this meeting today will benefit from a 10% discount on price.

## Pitch 1

## Pitch 2

## Pitch 3
