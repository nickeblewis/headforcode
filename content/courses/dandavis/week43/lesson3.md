# Lesson 2 - Creating a "Pull Request"

The last lesson was quite a big one, this is a bit smaller. In the last lesson, you learnt how to create a branch, make a minor change, commit that change and push it up.

Now supposing this was a bigger piece of work and not just changing a piece of text in a README.md file, we would need to review your work, don't panic because you will get to review mine too! 
We will always review code changes before applying them to the Master branch because in doing so, we are releasing changes to the live site. This process is more a way of checking that what is changing 
is not going to break anything that is currently running ok. A sanity check but also a great way of training you at this point in time.

So code reviews are something we shall be doing a lot of in the months to come.

SLACK CHAT: I had started to try to write this piece and have run out of time for the moment, so what we can do is have a chat on Slack and I can walk yout through it instead.
