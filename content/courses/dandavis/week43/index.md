# This weeks excercises

This week we are going to start doing some new things alongside CodeAcademy and Farnborough Guide, here is a quick overview.

* I am going to show you how to "clone" this website to your laptop using Git and your own Github account
* I will show you how to create a "new branch" both on "your local" and on what we call the "origin", effectively the Github server and explain what that is all about
* Using your new branch, I will give you a few easy excercises to complete
* Show you how to commit the changes you have made and push them to the remote server
* Show you how to create what we call a "pull request", code reviews and what that all means
* Show you how we then merge a branch once it is finished back into the master branch
* This all then culminates in seeing your changes being deployed to the headforcode.netlify.com server 
* We will then summarise what you've learnt over the course of the week and how we shall continue to use these workflows for the next piece of work
* What units have we covered in doing all of this?

## CodeAcademy

Once you have polished off the Command Line module, see if you can take a look at their courses on the following, they will complement the above excercises.
