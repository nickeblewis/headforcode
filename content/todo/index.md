# A whole bunch of TODOs

* Investigate how we use Google Analytics with our phenomic based sites
* Investigate how we can incorporate advertising
* Investigate the various plugins we can develop in React for these sites
* https://marcustisater.github.io/
    * I may rebuild headforcode using newest Phenomic
* jeet.gs


REFINE

* How about generation of side indexes? I want to be able to keep on adding masses of content and be able to find it with ease
    * Getting Algolia up and running would be very handy in this regard!
    * I recently supplied my website details and therefore we could now download the plugin for this??
