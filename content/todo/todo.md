# A whole bunch of TODOs

* Investigate how we use Google Analytics with our phenomic based sites
* Investigate how we can incorporate advertising
* Investigate the various plugins we can develop in React for these sites

REFINE

* How about generation of side indexes? I want to be able to keep on adding masses of content and be able to find it with ease
    * Getting Algolia up and running would be very handy in this regard!
